## FORMULA SHEET

### Similarity
- Area ratio = (Side ratio)²
- A(ΔABC)/A(ΔPQR) = (AB/PQ)² = (BC/QR)² = (AC/PR)²

### Circle
- Inscribed angle = ½ × Arc measure
- Central angle = Arc measure
- Angle between two chords = ½(sum of opposite arcs)
- Angle between tangent and chord = ½(measure of intercepted arc)

### Coordinate Geometry
- Slope m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)
- Distance = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]
- Midpoint = ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2)
- Section formula (internal): ((mx₂ + nx₁)/(m+n), (my₂ + ny₁)/(m+n))
- Centroid = ((x₁ + x₂ + x₃)/3, (y₁ + y₂ + y₃)/3)

### Trigonometry
- sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
- 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
- 1 + cot²θ = cosec²θ

### Mensuration
- Cone: Volume = ⅓πr²h, CSA = πrl, l = √(r² + h²)
- Sphere: Volume = 4/3 πr³, Surface Area = 4πr²
- Cylinder: Volume = πr²h, CSA = 2πrh
- Frustum: CSA = π(r₁ + r₂)l, l = √[h² + (r₁ - r₂)²]
